<h1>Playlist Creation Tools</h1>
<h2>How to build the Macintosh applications</h2>

<p>
Since most Macintosh users may not be familiar with the operation of
running shell scripts in a terminal, the Playlist Creation Tools
applications for the Macintosh were built using a special tool, provided
by a third party.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.sveinbjorn.org/platypus">Platypus</a> is a developer tool for creating application wrappers
around scripts. In other words, it creates Mac OS X applications
that execute a script which is bundled within the application.
Command line scripts can thus be run transparently from the graphical
window environment, integrating seamlessly with the user interface
</p>

<p>
Platypus is written by Sveinbjorn Thordarson and you can visit him
on the <a href=http://www.sveinbjorn.org/platypus>Platypus Product Home Page</a>
