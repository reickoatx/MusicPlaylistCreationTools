### What is this?

Most music player programs or devices let you view your songs
by artist, genre, or by playlist, and usually let you view your
entire collection. However, very few let you view your music by
folders or directories. If you have an extremely large music
collection organized into folders, this can be a serious limitation.

This package provides a set of three simple scripts (for Windows)
and applications (for Macintosh) that work with any music files.
Using the included instruction manual, they assist in automatically
generating playlists for your music based on how you organize them
into different folders.

All you need to do is follow the simple instructions to organize
your music files in a certain way, copy the script or application
into the place designated in the instructions, and then double
click or run the script or application and it will create all
of the playlists for you automatically.

This image shows one example of how music files may be organized
into folders (on the left) and the playlists that will be created
after these tools are used (on the right)

### Stanton SCS.4DJ Performance System

The playlists generated by these scripts are especially helpful
for owners of the

a fully integrated computer, software, and controller DJ system for
 mixing, scratching, performing live, and making recordings:

After following the directions and organizing your folders, this
is an example of how your newly created playlists would look,
when you access them through your SCS.4DJ unit:
